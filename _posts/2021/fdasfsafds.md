An h1 header
---------

Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ðŸ˜“



## An h2 header

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print(i)
~~~

```js
var slen = sent.length
var siz = 25
var a = -3, b = 0
var subsent = "x"

// Creates a function to capture substrings of sent - SECTION B
function makeSub(a,b) {
  subsent = sent.substring(a,b) ;
  return subsent;
}

//Creates a function that increments the indexes of the substring - SECTION C 
//each time and calls the makeSub() function to geneate strings
//a indicates start of substring and siz indicates size of string required
function newMake() {
  a = a + 3;
  b = a + siz
  makeSub(a,b);
  return subsent
}

//function uses loop to get changing substrings of target - SECTION D
//repeatedly calls newMake to get next substring
//uses setTimeout() command to arrange for substrings to display 
// at specified times
function doIt() {
  for (var i = 1; i <= slen ; i++) {
    setTimeout("document.z.textdisplay.value = newMake()", i*300);
    setTimeout("window.status = newMake()", i*300);
  }
}
```



### An h3 header

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:
      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

$$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
