--- I saw her and I know she was still extremely angry with me.

After dinner, we decided to do something to spend the Eve of Duanwu. She proposed we drink beers. I knew that she scared me a little bit. After all I haven't met any girl who would like to drink beers to spend a night. It means that she is either a lunatic, or was in a very big mood.
  
We went to a large market and buy some beers, domestic and external, and some other snacks. We then went to a octagonal pavilion where there is few people around. Now I would like to call it "the holy pavilion of love".

We spent an hour taking about each other and our stories, drinking beers, and when I finished them, I could feel alcohol was doing something to my body, driving me a little more nag. I couldn't help enclosing her and touching her arms. I watched her spectacularly pretty eyes and suddenly, I kissed her hair.

After a long time looking at each other, I asked her,"I want to kiss you. Can I?"

She said nothing but nodded her head.

I couldn't wait but put my lips on hers quickly.

Then I lost my mind, thinking that the whole world had stopped rotate, the wind had stopped flow and the air had become condense. I closed my eyes and tried to feel, to touch with my lips and to fuse myself into her body.

It's amazing, really.
